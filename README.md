## Disclaimers ##

This is purely a homebrewed set of Monogram presets for Slack. A few things to keep in mind:

- It isn't developed or endorsed by either company. 
- It's provided with no warranty and it may not work on your system.
- Future Slack or Monogram updates might break it.
- It's licensed under <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a>. Pull requests and issues are welcome :)

### Known Limitations ###

- No assignments available or possible for slider modules (inherent incompatibility)
- No assignments available or possible for Orbiter disc (inherent incompatibility)
- Some assignments may not work with non-QWERTY keyboards. This can be worked around by re-mapping the broken shortcuts in Monogram Creator (select module, choose Customize > Keyboard Mode)
